# Feed-Reader-Testing

In this project I was provided with a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they included 
[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, 
the testing was not completed and the application was left with an incomplete test suite. 
This is where I come in.

The completed test suites are found in the file jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.  In order to run the completed test 
follow the instruction below:
